<br> Our revels now are ended. These our actors, </br>
<br> As I foretold you, were all spirits and </br>
<br> Are melted into air, into thin air: </br>
<br> And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, </br>
<br> The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, </br>
<br> The solemn temples, the great globe itself, </br>
<br> Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve </br>
<br> And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, </br>
<br> Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff </br>
<br> As dreams are made on, and our little life </br>
<br> Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd; </br>
<br> Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled: </br>
<br> Be not disturb'd with my infirmity: </br>
<br> If you be pleased, retire into my cell </br>
<br> And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk, </br>
<br> To still my beating mind. (4.1.146-163) </br>
